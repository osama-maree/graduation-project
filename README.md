# A Website for the Palestinian Tabou
#### This document was submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the " Graduation Project" course, during the academic year 2022 - 2023 (Second Semester). 
### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
- First of all, we would like to thank God Almighty for giving us the opportunity and guidance to achieving our goal and to be successful in this part. Then we would like to thank our families for their upbringing of and their tireless efforts and support in every path we take to achieve our dreams and goals.

- We would like to express our special thanks to mentor Dr. Yousef Daraghma for his time and efforts he provided throughout the year. Your useful advice and suggestions were really helpful to us during the project’s completion. In this aspect, we are eternally grateful to you.

- Finally, all thanks to group members for sharing the positivity and invaluable assistance.

### ABSTRACT
- The idea of this project is designing the TABOU website to meet the needs of the Palestinian citizen.

- During our visit to the Land Registry Directorate in Tulkarm, we noticed that the completion of transactions by citizens or employees, from selling to buying, mortgaging, sorting, and many others, require time and burden, in addition to the need for a large number of official papers attested by departments and other official bodies. Therefore, we design a website for the Tabou that enables users to log in, create transactions for selling or buying lands, and track their transactions. The website is designed according to the requirements collected from the Land Registry Directorate. 

- We aim to operate a web-based website - for the Directorate of Land Registry - that facilitates citizens and employees, so that transactions are completed easily to the fullest without the need to waste time.

### Problem Statement

- As we mentioned briefly in the introduction about several issues in the subject that would waste the citizen's time in order to complete a transaction.
- As the completion of a transaction on your land needs to take a vacation from your work and personally go to the Land Registry and complete the transaction, and the problem lies in whether this transaction is not done through one government department and you need several other government departments, for example (a sale contract from the court, clearance of the municipality, etc.) 

- The matter will become more difficult and complicated, which would exhaust the citizen and assign him financially and physically instead of the delay that will occur when waiting for the roles, and if you are outside the borders of the country and need to do one of the land transactions such as selling, for example, you will have to authorize someone to follow these procedures and you will not be able to complete them in person.

- At this stage, we are planning to complete a site through which you can complete transactions electronically as much as possible as much as possible by providing a smooth and simple user interface that allows the user to open a transaction such as selling, for example, and track it electronically and find out if there is a defect in this transaction immediately and know the defect and work to fix it as soon as possible to complete the procedures faster and less tired and effort.

### OBJECTIVE

1.	Building a website that keeps a record of transactions and citizens' rights and properties.
2.	Ensure that the website is responsive and easy to handle.
3.	Ensure data protection and preservation from damage and loss instead of papers.
4.	Ensure that the site achieves its desired goal, which is to make it easier for citizens, save money and time, and reduce the burden.
5.	The platform should be easy to navigate and use, even for individuals with limited technical knowledge or experience

### Process Model 
We know that the project will go through a lot of changes in both functionality and design throughout the development time, and these changes happen due to three reasons, stated below:
1. We know what the general shape of the project is and what we want it to do, but we haven’t decided on the details which will require some changes in the design in the future.
2. Because most of us will be learning new frameworks for programming various parts of the project (i.e., front-end, back-end, etc...), So with time, we’ll get more familiar with these frameworks and therefore, find better and more efficient ways to solve problems and design a different approach for tackling these problems.
3. Our desire to add a new feature or to remove one if found necessary.
So, we wanted a development model that is flexible and easy to integrate changes with, and because of that, we decided to use an agile model which compared to other development models offers great advantages, to list some:
- Agile is an incremental approach and each increment is delivered within a certain time interval and between these time intervals comes the opportunity to apply changes to the design, functionality, or logic if needed, unlike the waterfall model in which after the development starts you can’t change the design.
- The way that agile works, it gives us and the client a working project within some time interval, and that project can be tested for bugs and given to people to use and give feedback and change some aspects in the next time interval, unlike other models that don’t provide a fully working product until the end of the development phase.
- Agile divides the project into increments which makes it easier to design these increments, rather than designing a complex system in one phase.
- Agile provides different models each one provides different techniques and tools to apply and achieve agile model principles, but in our case, we used the Scrum model, for the following reasons:
    - It is easy to use, mainly because it provides you with general guidelines to follow and it is up to you how to do them, which is easier than learning a new workflow.
     - Fast response to changes, where a new change can be easily added to the backlog, and therefore taken into consideration in the future plans.

For our project to be done, we plan to follow the Agile process model. Agile process model refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. We are planning to break project tasks into small iterations (scrums), where each scrum will take two weeks. The division of the entire project into scrums helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements.
