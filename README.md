### ABSTRACT
- The idea of this project is designing the TABOU website to meet the needs of the Palestinian citizen.

- During our visit to the Land Registry Directorate in Tulkarm, we noticed that the completion of transactions by citizens or employees, from selling to buying, mortgaging, sorting, and many others, require time and burden, in addition to the need for a large number of official papers attested by departments and other official bodies. Therefore, we design a website for the Tabou that enables users to log in, create transactions for selling or buying lands, and track their transactions. The website is designed according to the requirements collected from the Land Registry Directorate. 

- We aim to operate a web-based website - for the Directorate of Land Registry - that facilitates citizens and employees, so that transactions are completed easily to the fullest without the need to waste time.
