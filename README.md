### ABSTRACT
- The idea of this project is designing the TABOU website to meet the needs of the Palestinian citizen.

- During our visit to the Land Registry Directorate in Tulkarm, we noticed that the completion of transactions by citizens or employees, from selling to buying, mortgaging, sorting, and many others, require time and burden, in addition to the need for a large number of official papers attested by departments and other official bodies. Therefore, we design a website for the Tabou that enables users to log in, create transactions for selling or buying lands, and track their transactions. The website is designed according to the requirements collected from the Land Registry Directorate. 

- We aim to operate a web-based website - for the Directorate of Land Registry - that facilitates citizens and employees, so that transactions are completed easily to the fullest without the need to waste time.

### Problem Statement

- As we mentioned briefly in the introduction about several issues in the subject that would waste the citizen's time in order to complete a transaction.
- As the completion of a transaction on your land needs to take a vacation from your work and personally go to the Land Registry and complete the transaction, and the problem lies in whether this transaction is not done through one government department and you need several other government departments, for example (a sale contract from the court, clearance of the municipality, etc.) 

- The matter will become more difficult and complicated, which would exhaust the citizen and assign him financially and physically instead of the delay that will occur when waiting for the roles, and if you are outside the borders of the country and need to do one of the land transactions such as selling, for example, you will have to authorize someone to follow these procedures and you will not be able to complete them in person.

- At this stage, we are planning to complete a site through which you can complete transactions electronically as much as possible as much as possible by providing a smooth and simple user interface that allows the user to open a transaction such as selling, for example, and track it electronically and find out if there is a defect in this transaction immediately and know the defect and work to fix it as soon as possible to complete the procedures faster and less tired and effort.
